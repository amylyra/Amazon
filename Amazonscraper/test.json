No fallout!", "review_text": "I purchased this to use for my loose glitter that I apply to my eyes. The reviews are amazing and I have found some really great E.L.F. products in the past so I decided to give this a go. This adhesive is AWESOME. First of all: for the amount you receive, the quality and the asking price this is a total steal. I have seen other glitter adhesives go over the $10 mark, which I think is ridiculous. This one by E.L.F. takes the cake.I found the following things to be true:- There is very little, if any, fallout when applied correctly- I only had to apply this once to last all day- It dries clear- The product is very easy to work withI have a little method for using this adhesive and I think it is worth sharing:1. Dab adhesive onto ONE clean eyelid with an eyeshadow brush2. Immediately apply glitter on top of adhesive with another eyeshadow brush3. Use a tissue under your eye to collect any glitter that falls as you apply glitter4. Repeat steps 1-3.It is very important to apply adhesive on just one eye then immediately use the glitter. When one eye is complete, you can do the other eye. This helps the glitter stay well before the adhesive dries and prevents fallout.I have been raving about this adhesive to anyone who will listen because it is that good.

However, I do like this a lot for loose shadows and glitter. I found that it wore well throughout the day, but I did have some creasing on one of my eyes. Using a quality eyeshadow primer underneath helps with that, though, and the less shadow I put on, the less it creases. You have to work kind of quickly when you use this, because it dries down fast, and it's best to work with glitter primers when your base is sticky. Otherwise, you'll probably have a lot of fallout to deal with, and if you've already done your base it's the biggest pain to clean up dark glittery powder from under your eyes.I'm not sure if this product is comparable to Fyrinnae's Pixie Epoxy, but I used the e.l.f. Glitter Primer with one of Fyrinnae's loose shadows (Wicked). Granted, I used the shadow wet with setting spray, which always helps bring out duochromes, but the shadow was really vibrant. I definitely think it stuck to the glitter primer better than loose shadows do with my normal primer, and I had a lot less fallout using the sticky base as well. I'd recommend this for people who work with loose shadows, glitter, and very shimmery shadows, but not any one else.

The product does not have an applicator, like the UD primer, it can be squeezed right onto a makeup brush. The use of the applicator causes streaks and use of more product.2. Fuller coverage for less product.3.  Better price.It grabs the eyeshadow true to color all day, cooperates with my brushes and allows for a seamless look. If your eyeshadow palettes aren't the best, it will still make medium quality eyeshadows look great. (I've never tried it on low quality eyeshadow). I find that it works better unset with powder. If you prefer to set your eyes with powder you may want to consider UD. I find that an unset eye makes for better blending and less patchiness. Good product, good price, not much needed per eye.

In the past the two I used most were the Urban Decay Primer Potion and the Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  I started with UDPP but eventually moved over to using TFSI as I liked the texture of TFSI more.  UDPP always felt a bit more oily and liquidy compared to TFSI.  The problem I ended up having with TFSI is that after a while it separates, and then it turns into greasy mess too.Later I started using the Wet n Wild eye primer, which I really liked for a long time.  I pretty much liked the WnW as much as I liked TFSI, maybe a little more since it's cheaper.  However I noticed the WnW primer had kind of opposite problem of both UDPP and TFSI - whereas UDPP and TFSI are both more liquidy and oily (esp after TFSI separates), I find the WnW to be rather dry.I stopped wearing makeup for a couple of years, then recently I picked up a couple tubes of UDPP when it was on sale during black friday, thinking it's gotten much cheaper and surely UDPP is good.  Except I realized that it REALLY is much liquidier and greasier than I prefer.  Because of the liquidy texture, it seems to take much longer to pat it onto my lid, and the greasiness/liquidiness ends up not playing nice with the foundation around my eye area.  I tried to not put any fdnt on my eyelid, but it still was creating patchiness when I tried to blend it out at the edge of where the fdnt would meet the primer.  I noticed that the WnW primer was doing the same thing (though not as obvious).  At this point I don't have a tube of regular TFSI, just a sample of TFSI champaigne - and that was also doing the same thing.I picked the Milani eye primer up on a whim due to emilynoel83's youtube vids.  The texture is absolutely perfect - it's not liquidy/greasy like the UDPP, but it's not nearly as dry as WnW either.  Only time will tell if it separates or changes texture though, but even comparing brand new tubes of UDPP, WnW, and this together, this still have the best texture.  It also blends onto my eyelid super easily with zero patchiness where it meets foundation.  I also find that it doesn't disturb my concealer under my eyes either, and in general it somehow melds into my eyelid with minimum amount of need to pat/blend.  Both UDPP and WnW takes much longer.  I also find that I can simply pat it to blend, whereas both UDPP and WnW i had to tug/swipe (which then can cause more patchiness against fdnt and concealer).In terms of performance, it works as well as the other two.  I have oily skin but monolid so there's no crease to worry about.  Most primers work well on me, so just like with UDPP, WnW, and TFSI, this kept my eyeshadows on with no fading or melting, and vibrant all day.  I have yet to experience any oily pooling at the corner of my eyes from liner either (which used to happen back in the days, but it could've been because of the liner and not primer issues).For the price I paid, which is even cheaper than when UDPP went on sale, this is an excellent product.  I currently have a full new-ish tube of UDPP, an old sample of TFSI Champaigne, and a new-ish tube of WnW, and I still only wanna use this.  I also have a back up tube of UDPP that i literally do not know what to do with now.  Remind self to never buy backups, no matter how discounted, because I might find stuff I like better!  I believe the WnW primer is cheaper than this retail price (although with amazon S&S the price difference was only in cents level), but since the WnW is so much drier, I definitely still prefer this.  I'd rather shell over a couple of extra dollars and not run into my eyeprimer screwing with my foundation.", "review_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "Verified Purchase", "reviewer_name": "Kai"}, {"review_date": "May 5, 2017", "people_found_usefull": "3 people found this helpful.", "review_title": "Great bang for your buck primer", "review_text": "I like this primer.

Now, to be fair, I've never used Urban Decay or any other specifically eye shadow primer, so maybe what it did on me was \"normal\" -- or maybe eye shadow primers just are not going to work on my 46 year old eyelids.I consider my skin to be pretty \"normal\" -- a little oily in my T-zone, a little dry on my cheeks, and of course as I've gotten older, I've gotten more laugh and smile lines. I wasn't expecting this or any other makeup to work miracles.I tried it first with my fingertips. It came out thick and wasn't very easy to smear on and as soon as it went on, my lids got dry, the wrinkles/droops (extra eyelid skin) were accentuated. I felt like I looked 10 or even 20 years older.I washed it off and tried applying it with a brush. The application went *much* smoother, but the outcome was still dry, wrinkly, awful looking eyelids. I waited the prescribed 30 seconds and put on my eye makeup anyway (Sugar Pill eye shadow and It eye liner). The shadow was difficult to get on, didn't blend or spread the way it usually does, wasn't noticeably brighter/darker (although Sugar Pill is pretty highly pigmented to begin with, so there was only so far it could go). The shadow caked into all of the creases created by the primer and all of the wrinkles that either hadn't been there before or that I hadn't noticed before (around my lash-line). My eyeliner was harder to apply (instead of gliding on, my skin pulled and tugged and the line wasn't smooth or even). In short: it was a hot mess.I removed my makeup, moisturized like crazy and in about 10 minutes, my lids went back to normal--which for me *is* a few wrinkles and a little droopiness.I'm going to pass the primer down to my daughter to see if she likes it any better than I did.

Right when you begin applying this, the texture can be a bit scary but you just have to keep tapping and blending and within 5-10 seconds you're good.

As for its actual purpose, I've worn this under cream, wet and dry shadows and everything shows up prominately, blends quickly and stays put for 10+ hours.

The reviews are amazing and I have found some really great E.L.F. products in the past so I decided to give this a go. This adhesive is AWESOME. First of all: for the amount you receive, the quality and the asking price this is a total steal. I have seen other glitter adhesives go over the $10 mark, which I think is ridiculous. This one by E.L.F. takes the cake.I found the following things to be true:- There is very little, if any, fallout when applied correctly- I only had to apply this once to last all day- It dries clear- The product is very easy to work withI have a little method for using this adhesive and I think it is worth sharing:1. Dab adhesive onto ONE clean eyelid with an eyeshadow brush2. Immediately apply glitter on top of adhesive with another eyeshadow brush3. Use a tissue under your eye to collect any glitter that falls as you apply glitter4. Repeat steps 1-3.It is very important to apply adhesive on just one eye then immediately use the glitter. When one eye is complete, you can do the other eye. This helps the glitter stay well before the adhesive dries and prevents fallout.I have been raving about this adhesive to anyone who will listen because it is that good.

However, I do like this a lot for loose shadows and glitter. I found that it wore well throughout the day, but I did have some creasing on one of my eyes. Using a quality eyeshadow primer underneath helps with that, though, and the less shadow I put on, the less it creases. You have to work kind of quickly when you use this, because it dries down fast, and it's best to work with glitter primers when your base is sticky. Otherwise, you'll probably have a lot of fallout to deal with, and if you've already done your base it's the biggest pain to clean up dark glittery powder from under your eyes.I'm not sure if this product is comparable to Fyrinnae's Pixie Epoxy, but I used the e.l.f. Glitter Primer with one of Fyrinnae's loose shadows (Wicked). Granted, I used the shadow wet with setting spray, which always helps bring out duochromes, but the shadow was really vibrant. I definitely think it stuck to the glitter primer better than loose shadows do with my normal primer, and I had a lot less fallout using the sticky base as well. I'd recommend this for people who work with loose shadows, glitter, and very shimmery shadows, but not any one else.

The product does not have an applicator, like the UD primer, it can be squeezed right onto a makeup brush. The use of the applicator causes streaks and use of more product.2. Fuller coverage for less product.3.  Better price.It grabs the eyeshadow true to color all day, cooperates with my brushes and allows for a seamless look. If your eyeshadow palettes aren't the best, it will still make medium quality eyeshadows look great. (I've never tried it on low quality eyeshadow). I find that it works better unset with powder. If you prefer to set your eyes with powder you may want to consider UD. I find that an unset eye makes for better blending and less patchiness. Good product, good price, not much needed per eye.

In the past the two I used most were the Urban Decay Primer Potion and the Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  I started with UDPP but eventually moved over to using TFSI as I liked the texture of TFSI more.  UDPP always felt a bit more oily and liquidy compared to TFSI.  The problem I ended up having with TFSI is that after a while it separates, and then it turns into greasy mess too.Later I started using the Wet n Wild eye primer, which I really liked for a long time.  I pretty much liked the WnW as much as I liked TFSI, maybe a little more since it's cheaper.  However I noticed the WnW primer had kind of opposite problem of both UDPP and TFSI - whereas UDPP and TFSI are both more liquidy and oily (esp after TFSI separates), I find the WnW to be rather dry.I stopped wearing makeup for a couple of years, then recently I picked up a couple tubes of UDPP when it was on sale during black friday, thinking it's gotten much cheaper and surely UDPP is good.  Except I realized that it REALLY is much liquidier and greasier than I prefer.  Because of the liquidy texture, it seems to take much longer to pat it onto my lid, and the greasiness/liquidiness ends up not playing nice with the foundation around my eye area.  I tried to not put any fdnt on my eyelid, but it still was creating patchiness when I tried to blend it out at the edge of where the fdnt would meet the primer.  I noticed that the WnW primer was doing the same thing (though not as obvious).  At this point I don't have a tube of regular TFSI, just a sample of TFSI champaigne - and that was also doing the same thing.I picked the Milani eye primer up on a whim due to emilynoel83's youtube vids.  The texture is absolutely perfect - it's not liquidy/greasy like the UDPP, but it's not nearly as dry as WnW either.  Only time will tell if it separates or changes texture though, but even comparing brand new tubes of UDPP, WnW, and this together, this still have the best texture.  It also blends onto my eyelid super easily with zero patchiness where it meets foundation.  I also find that it doesn't disturb my concealer under my eyes either, and in general it somehow melds into my eyelid with minimum amount of need to pat/blend.  Both UDPP and WnW takes much longer.  I also find that I can simply pat it to blend, whereas both UDPP and WnW i had to tug/swipe (which then can cause more patchiness against fdnt and concealer).In terms of performance, it works as well as the other two.  I have oily skin but monolid so there's no crease to worry about.  Most primers work well on me, so just like with UDPP, WnW, and TFSI, this kept my eyeshadows on with no fading or melting, and vibrant all day.  I have yet to experience any oily pooling at the corner of my eyes from liner either (which used to happen back in the days, but it could've been because of the liner and not primer issues).For the price I paid, which is even cheaper than when UDPP went on sale, this is an excellent product.  I currently have a full new-ish tube of UDPP, an old sample of TFSI Champaigne, and a new-ish tube of WnW, and I still only wanna use this.  I also have a back up tube of UDPP that i literally do not know what to do with now.  Remind self to never buy backups, no matter how discounted, because I might find stuff I like better!  I believe the WnW primer is cheaper than this retail price (although with amazon S&S the price difference was only in cents level), but since the WnW is so much drier, I definitely still prefer this.  I'd rather shell over a couple of extra dollars and not run into my eyeprimer screwing with my foundation.", "review_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "Verified Purchase", "reviewer_name": "Kai"}, {"review_date": "May 5, 2017", "people_found_usefull": "3 people found this helpful.", "review_title": "Great bang for your buck primer", "review_text": "I like this primer.

Now, to be fair, I've never used Urban Decay or any other specifically eye shadow primer, so maybe what it did on me was \"normal\" -- or maybe eye shadow primers just are not going to work on my 46 year old eyelids.I consider my skin to be pretty \"normal\" -- a little oily in my T-zone, a little dry on my cheeks, and of course as I've gotten older, I've gotten more laugh and smile lines. I wasn't expecting this or any other makeup to work miracles.I tried it first with my fingertips. It came out thick and wasn't very easy to smear on and as soon as it went on, my lids got dry, the wrinkles/droops (extra eyelid skin) were accentuated. I felt like I looked 10 or even 20 years older.I washed it off and tried applying it with a brush. The application went *much* smoother, but the outcome was still dry, wrinkly, awful looking eyelids. I waited the prescribed 30 seconds and put on my eye makeup anyway (Sugar Pill eye shadow and It eye liner). The shadow was difficult to get on, didn't blend or spread the way it usually does, wasn't noticeably brighter/darker (although Sugar Pill is pretty highly pigmented to begin with, so there was only so far it could go). The shadow caked into all of the creases created by the primer and all of the wrinkles that either hadn't been there before or that I hadn't noticed before (around my lash-line). My eyeliner was harder to apply (instead of gliding on, my skin pulled and tugged and the line wasn't smooth or even). In short: it was a hot mess.I removed my makeup, moisturized like crazy and in about 10 minutes, my lids went back to normal--which for me *is* a few wrinkles and a little droopiness.I'm going to pass the primer down to my daughter to see if she likes it any better than I did.

Right when you begin applying this, the texture can be a bit scary but you just have to keep tapping and blending and within 5-10 seconds you're good.

As for its actual purpose, I've worn this under cream, wet and dry shadows and everything shows up prominately, blends quickly and stays put for 10+ hours.

I just tried it today with some eye shadows I bought recently. Compared to when I wore the shadows without the base, the shadows stayed on all day. It's possible to spend $20 or even more for eye shadow base from fancy companies. Many of these products come in tubes, so you might squeeze out more than you need, thus wasting expensive product.

I don't have particularly sensitive skin I would say, but maybe I'm allergic to something in the primer. Besides this fact, it still works great. If you can use it without this side-effect, I would definitely say go for it.

So now I start with a moisturizing balm and then apply the Shany and rub in thoroughly.  I apply my lipstick or stain and then lip liner. During the day or after eating or drinking, it simply fades to a natural lip color.  I never go through all that again during the day, I just refresh with a tinted gloss.  Now Eyes: My morning makeup routine is about 5 minutes longer than it needs to be because of a flaw in my permanent liner. Now I just apply this primer, which covers the flaw,, then a neutral shadow and then l line with my Stila liquid liner pen. So fast and easy.

Not a lot like the average YouTube beauty guru, but just enough to enhance my classic features and highlight my eyes and lips. I am currently using another brand as an eye primer so I purchased this specifically as a primer for my lipstick.After applying this primer for about a month now, I'd say its ok. Not exceptional performance, but not bad either. It comes in a round, one-inch high glass container that is about the circumference of an American quarter. The product is a light pinkish taupe shade, creamy in the container and on your fingertips but will quickly dry once applied on your lips into an almost white opaque shade - making you look like a corpse after it's applied on lips.The good thing about this primer is that it makes my lipstick's color brighter, but the downside also means the color is no longer as dense in hue as intended. By that I mean a super red lipstick will be brighter but no longer as red if it was applied without the primer. With this primer, red lipstick becomes pinkish, nude shades almost disappear and purple, brown and pink shade lipsticks all become lighter by two to three shades in color. In terms of the primer extending the Life of the lipstick on lips, it does. But not for hours on end. I've noticed it has added about two extra hours to my lipstick's wear. Unfortunately, as the lipstick color fades, It leaves a color ring around my lips, as if my lipstick was a thick lip liner, an effect that I hate because it looks unsightly and gauche.For spending only eight dollars on this product, I won't complain too hard, but still wished it added more wear to my lipstick.

I figured this was just normal until I discovered eyelid primer and decided I should at least try some to see how it works. Based on my searches, there are a lot of makeup primers on the market and I really didn't know which kind would work best for me but I came upon this Shany eye and lip primer and decided to order it because it looked like a good option to try.When it first arrived, I was surprised at how small the jar is. It was loose in the Amazon box with other purchases and could be easily lost so make sure you check the box carefully if you decide to purchase this product. I've included a picture of the jar compared to a quarter. I initially was annoyed that I had paid the money I did for such a small jar of primer but I've been using this for about four months and have barely made a dent in the jar so that makes me happier since it is lasting me a long time already. The primer has little to no scent and is very easy to apply. I just use my pointer finger to dip it in the jar and usually two applications per eye is enough for me. This primer is a lightly-colored, creamy powder and in the four months I've been using it, my makeup has stayed on all day with very little fallout. My makeup is even bolder too so it makes my eyes stand out! I don't have oily eyelids so I can't say how this product works with them but I've used it in the heat and humidity with good success in keeping my makeup flawless all day.Overall, I'm very happy with this product and I will buy it again when the time comes to buy more. At first, I didn't think it was worth the money considering the small size but it is lasting me a really long time already so I feel this product is worth the money. If you decide to purchase this, make sure you check your box carefully so it doesn't get thrown out with the packaging since it's a very small jar.

It takes a good rubbing with a makeup wipe to get this stuff off your eyes. It doesn't crease, as far as I have experienced, but I can tell it would if you put too much on at one time. The colour is a good neutral beige-y pink-y colour, and would work on any skin tone, but if you are a darker skin tone than my Oregonian paleness, you may want to make sure you get all of it covered with eyeshadow, otherwise it might look really weird. It makes any eyeshadow a bajillion times more pigmented and brilliant, and it works with any shade of shadow without changing the colour of the final look. This really is a great product. I will mention that the product definitely is a *base* and not just a primer. The product has some colour to it, and is not just a sheer primer.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.The only problems I have with this product is with the packaging and application process. The packaging is tiny, and it makes it really difficult to get a little bit out and use it. If you have longer fingernails and want to apply with your fingertips, you're going to get a bunch under your nails while trying to get it out. Now, the tiny packaging is not a problem when it comes to the amount of product you get. Believe me, this base will last you a good long time, as you don't use very much. The problem is just getting it out.The application process is a little difficult because of the consistency. Now, don't get me wrong, this base is the perfect consistency for applying to your lids and catching your shadow, but it's a little difficult to get it on your lids without smearing it somewhat everywhere. You really do have to have a very very small amounts at a time on your finger, or it's going to get everywhere on your eyes. It does nothing for your lashes except make them clump up a ton, but it's really hard to get this product down to the lash line without getting it on your actual lashes, due to the slipperyness of the cream. However, I wouldn't change the creaminess of this base for anything, I'm just saying it can be difficult, especially for the un-experienced makeup applicators.I would call this base comparable to, if not better than, the Smashbox or Urban Decay primers. The consistency of this product is easier than the SB or UD primers to apply precisely, but you really do have to be careful, as this base is pigmented, not sheer, so you don't want it going anywhere but where you are putting eyeshadow.", "review_rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "", "reviewer_name": "Kaylee Lyen"}, {"review_date": "September 28, 2015", "people_found_usefull": "3 people found this helpful.", "review_title": "Not a great primer for the lips.....", "review_text": "I was so excited to try this product when looking at the reviews.

One of my biggest frustrations was my eye-shadow, it would always crease and look like crap just a few hours out the door.  This I attribute to my aging eyelids (bleh).  I have used numerous eye primers and all have left me wanting.  The Shany primer is the first I have used that actually does what it is supposed to.  It is very creamy and easy to apply, just a dab will cover the entire lid.  Most importantly, the primer does not crease itself before I put on my eye-shadow.  I pat it on my eyelid, smooth it out, and right before I put on my shadow, I smooth it one more time and it stays smooth.  I can apply my eye-shadow by brushing it on vs having to pat the shadow on and then smooth out the shadow,  Again, as my lids are showing the effects of time, I don't need nor do I want a heavy layer of eye-shadow.  I wish to enhance, not be a you-tube wanna-be.  This primer would work wonders for that generation as well.  Once my shadow is in place and looks as I wish, it stays that way until I take it off at night.I highly recommend this primer.

It serves its purpose for your lip make-up but it would have been nice to also tend to the lips.This product also seems choosy about what lip-wear it will accept. A few of my lipstains seemed to sit on top of the primer, instead of being gripped to stay on. I'd say some of them did a better job by being in direct contact with my lips than on the primer.As with most lip cosmetics, this tastes awful so avoid eating it.If you apply too much, which you should try to avoid, it has a tacky feeling and your lips will stick together a little.I've imcluded images of my bare lips, lips with my NYC Everlasting Nude lipstain by itself, then with the lipstain applied with the primer. You can see the amazing difference this primer provides.I was gifted this off of my wishlist by a friend", "review_rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "", "reviewer_name": "Petite SunDrop"}, {"review_date": "January 18, 2016", "people_found_usefull": "8 people found this helpful.", "review_title": "Thumbs up!", "review_text": "A must buy!

When using it on my lips it does make the lips the same color as my face so I can draw a lip line really anywhere. It does help the lipstick stay in place. It doesn't dry and make my lips feel cakey.  When I apply it to my eyelids it does help to hide the dark. i mean I could go on vacation with the bags under my eyes. Woof... even though this is a primer and not a concealer it does well at both. It works well to help mattify a cream shadow and put on top of undereye concealer to help brighten the under eye area. I have ordered several other SHANY products and they are all top notch quality. They feel good, no harsh chemical smells, and do not irritate my somewhat sensitive skin.

My eye shadows have never creased once since using this primer; even after an hour workout outdoors in 85% humidity! The package may be small, but a tube typically lasts me 3-4 months. Sometimes it is difficult to get every last drop of primer out of the tube, but I will take out the little plastic \"stopper\" and that allows me to move the wand around better to get it all!

When I saw this, I went back and forth about buying it; but after seeing some of the \"divas\" in one of my beauty groups talk about and lip concealer even, I decided to try the concept first hand.  I wanted to go with sheer, since it looked like it would just blend to my natural honey/light tan skin tone.  It comes with a little soft brush wand and glides on super easy liquid foundation.  I use it all over my eyelid all the way up the brow and even sometimes use a little in my bag/under eye area to help even the skin color.The eyelid primer has made my black liquid eyeliner so much more intense; and my eyeshadows as well.  They have this huge pop with them and I find it helps in the eyeliner and shadow stay a little better through the hot sweaty Florida summer days.  It doesn't alter or lighten the color in anyway when I apply something over the eyelid primer.  The bottle gets me a pretty long way.

It blends in easily, and it doesn't appear to lighten the eyeshadows I use.  The primer itself goes on smoothly but needs to be blended in a little.  I've attached a pic so you can see difference in color between initially applied and blended against my pasty white skin.It's not a large tube at all, and the packaging is deceiving.  I won't put the effort into verifying whether it's exactly 0.11 ounces, but as you can see in the attached pic where I've held it under a light, the tube does not arrive fully filled.

But, that one is a colorless primer. They make a tinted version called \"Eden\", and that is what Stay Don't Stray most closely resembles. I did not know that Stay Don't Stray was a colored product or I would not have even bothered to purchase it; I don't need a primer that is also a concealer. I just want some eyelid glue for my eye makeup.*Before you use this, if you plan to leave the house, make sure you exfoliate any dry patches around your eyes, where you plan to use this. I promise that you won't notice how dry stuff looks until AFTER you are gone and can't do anything about it.*Expect that no matter how carefully you try to gently press the pump, it's going to dispense way more than you can use, and there is nothing you can do about it. This was frustrating to me. As expensive as this stuff is and I have to wash half of it off my hands every time I use it? No thanks.Benefit's product has an opaque coverage that is very fair; even on my pasty face it was pretty light. I can't imagine how this would show up on someone of darker coloring, it would probably look ghost-like. It was not as drying as the UDPP Eden, however it sure did showcase any dry areas I did have. And it stung all around my eye area!! This made my eyes water. Already by this point I had decided to return it. Nothing short of miraculous color retention was going to make me keep it.Wear: Not too bad. I did notice more emphasis on lines under my eyes after awhile, and I normally don't stick concealer under my eyes so I can only blame the Stay Don't Stray. I would say overall I am much happier with Urban Decay's Original primer for wear. I would not use UD Eden under my eyes, nor am I happy how the Stay Don't Stay looks under my eyes.PROSanitary packagingCovers discolorationsNot as drying as Urban Decay Primer Potion EdenCONIncredible waste of the product and there's nothing you can do about itNot as long-wearing as Urban Decay Primer Potion OriginalStung my eyesMust make absolutely sure that you have no residual dry areas where the product will be usedI'm returning it and won't repurchase or recommend.", "review_rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "", "reviewer_name": "Angie C."}, {"review_date": "December 30, 2011", "people_found_usefull": "3 people found this helpful.", "review_title": "Covers up under-eye circles and keeps shadow in place!", "review_text": "This product works exactly as it is supposed to.

For me, I tend to be towards the lovers of the product. Here, I think are the major points.First major test used: early evening application for a wild party birthday evening and a \"sleep over\" with younger man (I'm over 30, but in denial that I'm aging... as we all should be).  The make-up neutral/natural dramatic (3 eyeshadow shading) with powder eyeliner (MAC) and liquid eye-liner on top (Cheap drug store brand), cover the dark circles.  Application of product surrounded the eye raccoon style to give you that bright young \"base\" for which you can apply the darker brown/neutral shades on top for a sophisticated look  The stay put went to the brow.  My skin tone is medium, so this added a highlight effect to the brow shaping technique that i did.Performance:  Pass with flying color.  I awoke at 9am, slightly hung over, jumped over my young beau, so as not to awaken him, fearful that my face was going to be a distorted mess.  I looked ready to go back out on the town.  It held the cheap liquid eyeliner on top of a powder eyeliner I was testing as well as the eyemake-up despite having had \"night-time activities\" and sleeping in it.  This means it held the powder eyeliner on tightly along with the liquid. My \"night-time\" activities + sleepover would have generally resulted in make-up across my face.  The dark circles (now accentuated by alcohol with inadequate hydration) were not visible.Notes:  I have a good medium foundation for which to ultimately blend color on top. I'm not sure if some of the other reviews are trying to use this as a concealer/liquid foundation.  That seems a little odd to me... it's a primer not a foundation. Alternatively, I wonder if those using the product are using a powder foundation or liquid.  I can say with a liquid foundation or liquid + powder foundation you're good to go. I haven't extensively tried this with only a powder foundation. The texture is close to a light liquid foundation, not thick like a concealer.Test 2:  All day work and then go on to party at night.  Application 7am - ????Performance:  Not bad, still required re-ap. While there is a notable difference between when I use this and do not, this product will not hold eye make-up all day perfectly.  The touch ups are more minor and it will still show lighter around the eyes if you are using shading techniques to manage dark circles and increase that youthful eye look. However, you'll want to re-ap if you're doing anything more than going to the grocery store and going home.Note: if you're an eye-rubber - especially if you're a contact wearing eye-rubber - then you will think this product doesn't work.  Look.. it holds make-up on your face. If you're rubbing your eyes, then the darken flecks of your mascara that ends up in your eyemake-up is going to make you think this stuff isn't working.Final Review:  If you're primarily interested in holding eye make-up and you are not doing something crazy/christina aguillera show make-up, then go for it.  If your make-up regiment includes holding massive amounts of a single shadow that must stay uniformly applied, then go for the urban decay product.  That is the style they are selling anyway. However, if you have more of a relaxed neutral blended style, you'll be fine with this one and appreciate the lightness.  As for irritation, the product allowed me to withstand the irritation I usually get from the cheap drug store liquid liner, so for most this should be a good product on that test.", "review_rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "", "reviewer_name": "1000Books"}, {"review_date": "December 28, 2010", "people_found_usefull": "", "review_title": "Don't waste your money", "review_text": "There are multiple problems with this product:1- it dispenses too much at a time, you end up wasting half the product.2- it does NOT keep eye makeup from creasing.

I really cannot speak highly enough of it.I will say that for those of you who are used to only using the weird silicone-y flesh coloured primers, this one being more like a lotion, has a little bit of 'tack' to it. I recommend putting it on your lids/brows, then proceeding with the rest of your makeup while it dries a little bit.

The second thing I absolutely love to do with this eye primer is to create a very fresh, natural, soft, dewy look, it blends beautifully with other products to help create this look.Otherwise, as I said, I highly recommend this for anyone who is elaborate in the way they put on eye makeup or anybody whose eyelids are incredibly oily and eye makeup doesn't stay in place.

I've tried maybe ten brands.  Most of the expensive department store ones are heavy and tinted, sort of like foundation or under eye concealer. Besides costing a fortune, they are definitely not for older eyes--they accentuate every crevice and wrinkle.This e.l.f product is consistently my favorite--it goes on light with almost no color, does not emphasize wrinkles, and stays on all day.  Most companies tell you to wear it with colorless powder although almost none of the reviews mention that.  I do think it works even better if you powder first but I understand that doing so adds another step and more expense.BUT if you powder first you have a lot more control putting on powdered eye shadow--it's much harder for the eye shadow to go on unevenly (and really if you're going to all this trouble then get a good magnifying make-up mirror and you'll see what I mean).  If you have oily eyelids (or you put other products on your eyelids first) powdering is essential.  (And yes, I've tried powder alone and it helps but the combination is amazing.)The only thing that comes close is another cheap one--NYX creme that comes in a jar.  It goes on whiter but sort of fades (that's good)..My major complaint with the e.l.f product is that so little comes in each tub--and all that packaging is deceptive and wasteful.

I've tried it with several different eyeshadows from a 32 color geometric palette from e.l.f. and I got creases with every color by mid-afternoon.  I also tried it with the e.l.f. mineral \"naked\" palette eyeshadows and got creases.  The creases usually didn't appear until mid-afternoon, so I guess maybe this just isn't very long lasting.Also, for what it's worth, this is inexpensive, but there doesn't seem to be very much product in the tube.Bottom line: this may work with some eyeshadows.

So, check your local Target store. You can see the price advertised on their website, but they only sell in stores. So, you can buy 3 of these for $3.00 and stock up.UPDATE 1/2/2014:  I went to Target, and I can confirm that these are just $1.00 each. I purchased 3 as planned. Can't beat the price. Also, you may have to really search for these, because they were not stocked with the other ELF products, but they were stocked nearby hanging on a peg near ground level with some other brands. The inventory number for these at Target is #052-03-0605, so if you can't find them just provide the number to one of Target's associates, and they will help you.

Once I finally got it applied I waited a few minutes before applying any eyeshadow, to give it a chance to set or dry or whatever. Then, I applied my eyeshadow. I thought that if anything I would use less shadow than usual because primer is supposed to make your shadow appear brighter and make your eyes \"pop\" right??? So I began applying my eyeshadow sparingly at first but wound up using well more than I usually would because the primer seemed to suck all the pigment out of it and make it appear diluted and faded. An hour after I finished applying my makeup I checked my face in the mirror before leaving the house and found that my eyeshadow looked HORRIBLE...the little bit that was still clinging to the outer edges of my eyes and bunched up in my crease did anyway. The rest of it was gone. Where did it go? I can't say for sure. Perhaps the e.l.f. Essential Eyelid Primer ate it.

I have used an expensive primer in the past that I\u2019m comparing it to, but I forget which brand (I got it at a department store makeup counter).The Elf primer goes on well, you have to even it out with your fingers. This one is completely sheer, but I also bought it in \u201cpearl\u201d. The consistency is a little less smooth than the more expensive one I\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. What I LOVE is that my eye shadow adheres great to it, comparable to the department store one. The shimmery eye shadow I wear would always have a hard time staying on and it would end up falling off quickly. This has really helped it stay put all day. I love the sheer one for my brown and natural colors. I use the pearl primer if I want to do something more colorful and vibrant (which is rare, but I did use it to blue and green up for the superbowl). Pearl gives me almost a white paper, blank canvas effect. It works great for bold. I lean more toward browns and natural, which the sheer is great for.Like others have said, Target has stellar prices on their E.l.f. products, so if you live close to a store that\u2019s a great place to buy them. I did like the more expensive one better, but again I really pick and choose what makeup I spend my money on, it\u2019s usually foundation and powders that I splurge on, the other stuff I don\u2019t mind going cheap on.

Even if it's warm outside, it still holds up nicely!The primer itself looks a bit different than what most of us are used to seeing...it comes out looking like a white lotion vs the usual tinted appearance that most primers have...the best part is you need VERY LITTLE...I put a small dab on my right hand middle finger and then I take my left middle finger and dab them together so I have and equal amount of product on both fingers and then I close my eyes and gently tap, tap, tap on my eyelids (very lightly)...I actually put a bit of foundation on my lids before I use the primer...to be clear, I've worn this eye primer over my foundation as well as under it and I have had the same results either way...it's just a matter of preference as to which I grab first to apply...I only use foundation on my forehead and eyelids because that's where I tend to be a bit oily so the rest of my face is au natural....anyhow, once I finish tapping my eyelids and generally have what feels to be no product left, I will do a quick tap on my forehead (right between my eyebrows in the T Zone) and it actually helps to keep that area on the matte side...there appears to be a minute amount left on my fingers because I tap and don't rub my eyelids so that's why even the teensiest bit of product left on your fingers (even if you can't see it) is quite helpful for other areas as well...then I finish off with a quick press of a translucent powder to set everything...I initially bought the Tarte eye primer from eBay in a sample sized tube just so I could try it without sinking money into a product I might not like...I'm glad I tried this primer and since then I purchased the full size product here on Amazon...this is one product I wouldn't want to be without!", "review_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "Verified Purchase", "reviewer_name": "fab4gal"}, {"review_date": "May 26, 2017", "people_found_usefull": "", "review_title": "Awesome product", "review_text": "Dang, this stuff works!!!", "review_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "Verified Purchase", "reviewer_name": "Alisa A.

I guess it's my age (51) and some weird delicate balance between oily and dry, but my lids started to get a bit flaky if I left my eye makeup and primer on all day. Not so with UD's anti-aging formula! Not only does it keep my shadow and liner on every bit as good as LimeCrime did, but it seems to condition my eyelids so I don't have one bit of dryness and flaking. Who can't use a little anti-aging? For me this is the perfect formula for an eyeshadow primer.

Packaging -- the crayons were loose, stuck to the inside of the lid, as reported by others.  Not a big deal for me, just tap the bottom on the table to unstick it from the lid, twist up a little, then lightly press as you twist the crayon back down.  It will hold the crayon if it doesn't get banged around.  Wearability:  This was all applied on top of silicone-based primer, and CoverGirl neutralizer concealer stick.  The Bronze and Champagne both seemed to \"clump\" color, almost waxy, where pigment would stick in some spots on my eyelids, but not in others...Bronze reminded me of age spots!, neither of these two were very blendable.  The Gold went on better, a bit smoother and much more even-coverage with pigment, more blendable.  Subtle shine and light bounce for all three, very good for daytime makeup, blending will make a lot of the shimmer come off onto your finger/sponge.  THEN I tried the Bronze and Champagne on top of silicone primer only, no concealer or lid primer which can sometimes dry out or cake on my eyelids; they smoothed out and acted more like the Gold with the slick base of the primer.  Gold was a dream in this instance, like silk.  Overall, a great product for the price and a good staple for quick-do makeup.  I can't attest to staying power -- I wear minimal makeup, and don't usually wear it for more than a few hours at a time.  I work a job that's half physical and half public relations, a lot like a park ranger; I carry the Gold in my bag with a plum lip/cheek tint for pop-up meetings with the press.  Simple & understated, perfect for my needs.  Minus one-half star for the variability of the pigmentation and having to go without concealer on Bronze and Champagne, and minus one-half star for the way the crayon comes unstuck from the twist base (there are better designs out there for twist-ups).  4.5 stars for Gold, 4 stars for Bronze & Champagne; overall product 4 stars, b/c more shades seem to pigment clump than don't.", "review_rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "Verified Purchase", "reviewer_name": "LadyE"}, {"review_date": "July 3, 2015", "people_found_usefull": "8 people found this helpful.", "review_title": "Primer is Perfect as a concealer!", "review_text": "Primer is the best concealer for melasma, age spots I have ever found.

I think the secret to applying it is to dot on just a little and then blend it really well.  I like it much better when worn with shadow.  I don't wear eyeshadow very often.  Instead I go for a nude look with just this primer (or foundation) and ELF HD powder.  I will continue to use it though because it does help powder shadows stay true and to last all day and into the night.

I used my fingers, a brush, a makeup sponge wedge and nothing worked very well.  I tried adding some eye cream as recommended, but it didn't blend well at all.  Instead, it went on really cakey-like and made deep creases in the fine lines around my eyes.  I also tried heating it up a bit with my hands, but that didn't soften it any.

Dip your brush into some type of thick creamy moisturizer(I use Nivea), then into the Lemon Aid. It just glides on, and is very easy to blend.2. To best cover the awful pouches, tilt your head slightly down while looking into the mirror. See those dark rings at the bottom of the pouches? Put the concealer on just those dark rings...not on the pouches themselves. I learned that the pouches cause shadows that form the dark ring, so if you can make those shadows go away....voila... you can no longer see the pouches...amazing but true.

I just thought it was an eyelid primer (though I'll admit to being a bit puzzled about the color).  I do not get dark circles and don't have redness around my eyes, and yellow concealers look wrong elsewhere on my face due to my skin tone, so I have only been using this as an eyelid primer.  Thus, that's the only use I will talk about today.As a primer, this is wonderful.  It has a somewhat creamy texture but isn't too liquidy like other eyelid primers.  Texture-wise, I think I even like it more than the Urban Decay Primer Potions, and that is saying something, since I have been using those for years.  This can't separate like the liquid primers, and it dries faster (because it's not really \"wet\" to begin with).  I find this easy to spread around on the eyelid; I prefer to apply with a finger.  It does not cause any irritation (I have sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses, so this is important).You don't have to wait much (or any) time at all before putting shadow over this.  I think the lightness of the color of the primer really helps shadow colors stand out (in a way that other primers don't).  I have mostly been using loose powder shadows lately, some with a bit of sparkle in them, and they stick pretty well to this (I don't know that full-on glitter would; I would think you'd still need a special primer for that).  I am not getting any creasing, even though I have super oily eyelids.  That is pretty much all I can ask for in an eyelid primer.In the end, this may be edging out the UDPP for my favorite eyelid primer.

It nicely covers all veins and such on my lids and leaves a smooth canvas for eyeshadow application.  Again, it doesn't really make them last longer on the lids, but it does help them cling better, show truer color and they blend better over this primer.

I've been using this for probably close to 8 years or so. This is my go to concealer. I've tried creams and sticks before and that stuff goes on so cakey, it's disgusting. This stuff is not liquid enough to spill everywhere but it is not a heavy cream either, it's right in the middle. That makes it highly blendable and easy to make look natural.I don't wear foundation, I just cover any spots or areas with this (the color matches my skin well enough) and I'm done. I can't say it's super buildable - it isn't BB cream or tinted moisturizer light but it's not heavy coverage either. Again, right in the middle.In terms of undereye circles, this stuff does a great job as long as you use proper technique in applying under the eyes (triangle method) and depending on what the skin/terrain under your eyes is like. One of my undereye circles is uneven, with a dip and that makes it much harder to cover the darkness, while the other is perfectly flat, so this concealer does a great job with it.If you're oily or sweaty, it will travel/budge a little but it will NOT be running down your face. Invest in some oil absorbent shine sheets and you will prolong its wear-time. If you get this stuff on clothes, pretty much forget about getting out, it really soaks in very quickly when it touches fabric.One thing that's annoying about the construction of the tube itself is that it tends to crack as the product depletes, I've had many tubes of this and it happens every time. It splits at the very top where the screw tracks are and the product starts to come out of places other than the brush-tip. This can lead to little messy accidents, so be aware. Also, a good bit of product is left in the tube by the time you can't squeeze any more from the tip. Just take the brush tip off with your nails and use something (the other end of a skinny eyeshadow brush ... etc) to get into the tube and get the product out, if you're like me and want to maximize how much you get out of this.It's cheap, not cakey, easily blendable and still lets your skin breathe, get it!

This has less product in it than UDPP's (0.37 oz) but it is still considerably cheaper. So far, I think this is a pretty good dupe for UDPP. I noticed that this had a slightly more of an emollient/moisturizing texture than the UDPP, but it's not greasy. I have read online that some people experience oil separating from both the UDPP and this coastal scents version, but have not noticed it myself. It's probably a good idea to keep the product in a cool area away from direct sunlight, just in case. The product is thick and the nozzle on the tube is perfect for squeezing out the right amount needed.  I swatched this along with the UDPP on my hand with some eyeshadow and it definitely makes eyeshadows bolder, however I noticed that it washed off more quickly than the UDPP as well, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preference. It has passed my eyeshadow and eyeliner smudge test and kept my eye makeup in place for the 7 hours that I had it on.

I've gone through two tubes already and I just bought about a month ago. It's a great price but it seems so wasteful. Plus the applicator is just terrible.

My boyfriend and I were planning on going out with some friends, so I wanted to use this chance to test out the primer! I tend to have oily eyelids, so I thought this was a good product to invest in, without spending too much.I was a bit taken aback by the product. I have never used eye shadow primer before, so I was not sure what to expect. I did not sense any odd smells, and the consistency appeared normal. I applied ELF's Eye Shadow primer and the Maybelline shadows around 5pm. It was rather simple to apply: Dab the product on to the eyelid, blend, and let it set for a few minutes before applying the shadow.So, my friends and I went out, then later decided to come back to our house. At this point, it's about 9pm and my eye shadow still looks like how I applied it! If I were to normally apply eye shadow with no primer, it would have faded -- fast!It was a nice evening, and we all decided to go take a walk. Now, it's about 10pm. Unfortunately, it started to rain while we were walking back to the house. Fast forward, it's about 11pm now. I check on my eye makeup while I'm changing clothes in the bathroom, and it's still there! Granted, it faded A LOT because of the rain, but I'm otherwise pretty impressed that it's still there!It's getting late, some friends leave, while others decide to stay the night (around 1am). I was too tired to go take off what was left of my makeup, so I just went to right to bed. Wake up at 10am, go to the bathroom, my eyeshadow is still there! Okay, okay, it's basically faded off by now, and all that's left is a a hint of brown shadow; but, if I were to normally go without primer, the eye shadow would have been gone by now. Hell, it would have been gone by the time I got home around 9, probably even an hour after I applied the eye shadow.If you're reading this review, and you're interested in trying this, go and buy it! I am NOT disappointed. As I said before, I have not used any eye primers before, so this is my first one and I don't have much experience to compare; however, comparing the primer to no primer at all, ELF's Eye Shadow Primer is fantastic! I'm super glad I bought the three-pack value so I'm stocked for a good while! :DUPDATE (4/12/14): I decided to update this review, and nothing has changed: this stuff is still pretty amazing :). Yesterday, I applied this and my eye shadow around  1pm. The weather was about 80 degrees, with 40% humidity (I live in Maryland, to give you an idea...). I was walking a lot outside, so of course, I begin to sweat. Around 4pm I checked my makeup, and the eye shadow looked as if I had just applied it; no creasing or fading, whatsoever. I went along with the rest of my day, and around 12:30am (so, end of the day for me), I noticed a bit of creasing, but otherwise nothing has, again, changed. While this may be a problem for some, this does not deter my opinion about this product. The fact that it lasted *11 hours* through sweating, humidity, and a long day is VERY impressive to me. I tend to get oily eye lids, and before I decided to get the ELF Eye Shadow Primer, the eye shadow would have faded off AND have developed a lot of creasing after about an hour or two.I.e: BUY THIS!", "review_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "is_verified_purchase": "Verified Purchase", "reviewer_name": "Rebecca"}, {"review_date": "June 1, 2015", "people_found_usefull": "One person found this helpful.", "review_title": "Long lasting and no smearing", "review_text": "Considering this product is so affordable, it works really well!!

It dries quickly and, because it's a little lighter in color than my skin, the pigments of my eyeshadows are quite bright.  Also, it gives my eye makeup more staying power than the regular eye primer from e.l.f. does.  The Pixi primer actually works with e.l.f. shadows (i.e., inexpensive shadows), too, which is something I'd been looking for.  It's non-irritating to my sensitive skin, as well.However, this is not perfect.  I do still get creases by the end of the work day -- though they're less of a problem than they used to be.  Blotting papers applied to the eyelid definitely help.  Also, I don't care for the applicator (I don't like these spongy applicators in general; I find that you lose control of where the product goes).  And there is a tendency to twist the bottom too much and dispense too much product, especially upon first use; it takes a long time for the primer to get to the sponge the first time (it's better on the second and subsequent times you use it).Still, as I said, this is probably the best eye primer I've tried so far.
